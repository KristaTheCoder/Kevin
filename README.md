## Why Kevin
Kevin is the name of my rubber duck.

 Whenever I get stuck on python, Kevin is always their to help. Which is why Kevin would make such a great AI bot, considering it's written in python. We want Kevin to act as humanly, but rationally as possible, to be able to beat anyone in his favorite game, 3-player Kuhn Poker. Dale is not familiar with Kevin the duck, but he is excited about Kevin the AI.
